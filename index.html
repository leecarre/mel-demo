                    <h2>I worked with Mel on regular radio shows, adverts and pilots for a number of years. Mel was a main voice for a music radio show I produced for Heineken. The shows were broadcast across the Caribbean and Africa for over 4 years, and Mel was a delight to work with.</h2><p>Curtis James - Radio Producer</p>

                <h2>Bio</h2>

                <div class="bioBodyContent"><p>Melissa has over 17 years’ experience as a broadcaster, voice actor, entrepreneur and communications consultant. She’s always had a dramatic streak, which led to her studying English Literature at Leicester University and Turin University, Italy. A few years later, she gained an MSc in Marketing Communications from the University of the West of England.</p> 

                    <p>In 1999, a few chance meetings in a Brighton pub led to Melissa's first stint in commercial radio at Surf 107.2 as station voice. She went on to co-present the breakfast show on Gemini FM for 3 years, and hosted Sunday breakfast on dance station Galaxy 101 in Bristol. Numerous voice gigs for major brands followed, including Heineken – where she spent 5 years as the main voice for ‘Found @ Thirst’ – an annual DJ competition held across the Caribbean.</p>

                    <p>Melissa has hosted numerous music events, corporate gigs and festivals – including The Bishopstock Blues Festival 2003, featuring Nina Simone.  She cut her acting chops in a 6-week run of Aladdin in 2003, as the Empress of China for New Pantomime Productions, and the following year appeared in Jack and the Beanstalk.</p>

                    <p>In 2010, Melissa founded national podcasting platforms - Audio Enable and Radio in Schools, in association with Global Radio – the UK’s largest radio group. She works closely with the education sector and regularly offers training for teachers and students, and has written GCSE study guides for local radio. From 2007 to 2010 she regularly guest-lectured in live radio at Ravensboune College, London.</p>

                    <p>Melissa spent 3 years as Head of Comms for digital agency, e3 and went on to consult for agencies and start-ups, including SecondSync - which was acquired by Twitter in 2014. She also voiced their corporate videos.</p> 

                    <p>In 2016, Melissa moved to San Francisco with her young family and took the opportunity to develop her knowledge of the various approaches and techniques of acting. She is currently studying at the American Conservatory Theatre and regularly attends acting groups in the Bay Area.</p> 

                    <p>Melissa is now based in the U.S. as a full-time voice actor and is currently represented by Stars, The Agency.</p>
